comments:

● Avoid redundancy in your comments; don’t write what you do, write why you do it.

● Descriptive variable/function/class names are better than descriptive comments.

● Summarize as much as possible; do not write paragraphs if it is not absolutely necessary.

● Try to always use the same language and style of comments.

● Over time, comments are not usually maintained (modified) code is.



variable:

You should use only let and const for these reasons:

● The scope is clearer (between braces).

● It does not create global objects.

● It flags errors if you redeclare them.
